# BCI & Crypto currency

BCI and Cryptocurrencies have a number of possible synergies and applications:

* Allowing for an entirely digital commercial experience without any third parties like PayPal
* Real time transfer of assets (especially micropayments)

## Examples / Proofs of concept

### Initiate a bitcoin transaction via BCI
* Set some trigger like level of concentration
* Initiate a bitcoin transaction where recipient is defined

### Bitcoin tennis
* A 2 player game where a transaction is signed and sent to the other person, back and forth
* Size of transaction could be determined by level of concentration etc.

### Real-time asset trades as per a game
* Existing games have particles flowing from one player, much like a flow of energy
* Once support for [micropayments increases](https://lightning.network/), these could be represented as real tokens
